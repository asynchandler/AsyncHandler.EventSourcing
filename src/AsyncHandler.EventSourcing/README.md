Currently supports Azure Sql database and Sql Server, with Postgres in the upcoming releases.

Use docker to run sqlserver or postgres databases, execute `docker-compose`.

##### Install the package

Simply install `AsyncHandler.EventSourcing` package.

    dotnet add package AsyncHandler.EventSourcing

##### Use `AddAsyncHandler` service collection extension

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAsyncHandler(asynchandler =>
{
    asynchandler.AddEventSourcing(source =>
    {
        source.SelectEventSource(EventSources.AzureSql, connectionString);
